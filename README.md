**Problem Description**

Short text stream clustering has emerged as a critical challenge in handling the exponential growth of short text data across various social media platforms.

The proposed model-based short text stream clustering algorithm, MStream, aims to address the inherent challenges of concept drift and sparsity in such data streams.

MStream achieves state-of-the-art performance with a single pass of the stream, and demonstrates improved performance with multiple iterations of each batch. Additionally, an enhanced version of MStream, called MStreamF, integrates forgetting rules to efficiently manage outdated documents by removing clusters associated with outdated batches. 

The significance of this project lies in its ability to effectively cluster short text streams while addressing concept drift and sparsity issues, thereby contributing to advancements in text stream clustering algorithms.
